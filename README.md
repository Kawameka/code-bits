This repository will hold files that include code snippets that I believe will be commonly used in various languages/frameworks. 

Current Code Bit Files include:
- Angular Code bits
- Ruby Code bits
- C++ Code bits
- React Code bits

To add more Code Bits:
- Either add to the current files (e.g. add Angular code snippets to the AngularCodeBits.js file) or create a new file for a language/library/framework (e.g. ReactCodeBits.js or PythonCodeBits.py).
- If you create a new file, be sure to add it to the Readme file!
- Add comments your code bits to explain what they do.
- Try to follow the template of numbering code bits in the AngularCodeBits.js file.
